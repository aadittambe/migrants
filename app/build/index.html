            <p>The world has experienced a mass exodus of migrants fleeing war zones,
                violence and
                persecution in the past decade, in
                search of economic opportunity and safety. Their journeys are often marked by hardships — including
                shipwrecks,
                kidnappings and extortion — and their stories go untold.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>48,319 migrants have either died or gone missing worldwide while migrating toward an international
            destination,
            according to data collected by the Missing Migrants Project.
        </p>

        <p>The database, published by the International Organization for Migration, is the only one of its kind, and was
            developed in the wake of 2013 shipwrecks
            off the coast of Italy, which killed more than 368 people migrating from the Middle East and North Africa.
        </p>

        <p>The Missing Migrants Project collects and verifies information on deaths and disappearances across the world
            every day
            from national authorities, NGOs, media reports, and interviews with surviving migrants. It classifies every
            class based on the region it was recorded in, the international border it was recorded at, and the cause of
            the death.
        </p>

        <p>An analysis of the data set found that most deaths were along the central Mediterranian route. This route is
            used be
            thousands of migrants who seek to enter the European Union through Libya by sea. In 2017, the European Union
            began
            funding Libyan coastguards to rescue migrants at sea, in addition to enacting measures to further reduce
            migration on
            this route. </p>

        <p>As a result, the route has seen a fall in migrants since 2017.

        <p>Migrants may die in transportation accidents, shipwrecks, violent attacks, due to medical complications, or
            due to a
            combination of two or more of these reasons during their journeys.

        <p>The U.S.-Mexico border has the highest number of deaths related to unknown causes. Deaths documented on the
            U.S.-Mexico border since 2014 make up the largest death toll on any single border crossing between two
            countries.
        </p>

        <p>Out of the 7,972 deaths recorded with the cause "unknown or missing," 2,019 deaths have taken place in North
            America, making it the leading cause of migrant deaths in the continent. </p>

        <p>The maritime journey to Greece, often undertaken on overcrowded rubber boats, is a key route — the number of
            people seeking to cross reached its peak between 2015 and 2016, when more than 1 million people passed
            through Greece in hopes of traveling on to other parts of the European Union, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/12/25/greece-migrant-shipwreck-paros/">The Washington
                Post</a>.</p>

        <p>Overall the number of migrants entering Europe has declined since 2016, in part because of anti-immigrant
            policies in some European countries. The coronavirus pandemic — which sparked lockdowns and tighter border
            rules worldwide — led to a drop in border crossings.</p>

        <p>In recent months, however, deaths have once again begun to increase. On April 21, the Tunisian coast guard
            said four boats carrying 120 African migrants and refugees headed for Italy had sunk off the
            coast near the city of Sfax. The incident killed at least 17 migrants, while five remain missing. The boats
            were headed to the coast of Italy. <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/24/dozen-dead-10-missing-as-migrant-boat-sinks-off-tunisia">98
                African refugees</a>, who were conflict and poverty in Northern Africa and the Middle East, were
            rescued. </p>

            <h4>Methodology and sources</h4>
            <p>All data comes from the <a href="https://missingmigrants.iom.int/"></a>Missing Migrants Project. It
                is
                current as of May 1, 2022.</p>

            <p>A “migrant” is defined as a person in the process of migration toward an international destination,
                regardless
                of their
                legal status.</p>

            <p>The count excludes deaths that occur in immigration detention facilities or after deportation to a
                migrant’s
                homeland,
                as well as deaths more loosely connected with migrants’ irregular status, such as those resulting from
                labor
                exploitation.</p>

            <p>The Missing Migrants Project gathers data from diverse sources such as official records – including from
                coast
                guards
                and medical examiners – and other sources such as media reports, NGOs, and surveys and interviews of
                migrants.
                As
                collecting information is challenging, all figures remain undercounted.</p>

            <p>The “region of incident” comes from the Missing Migrants Project's <a href="https://mmp.factory.iomdev.org/regional-classification">classification</a>, and is based on
                current migration
                patterns and
                contemporary common language usage.</p>

                — which houses code for this project and the raw data that powers the maps and charts on this page — can
